To calculate the Rate:
First: work out the difference (increase) between the two numbers you are comparing.
Increase = New Number - Original Number
Then:  divide the increase by the original number and multiply the answer by 100.
% increase = Increase รท Original Number ร 100.
If your answer is a negative number then this is a percentage decrease.
