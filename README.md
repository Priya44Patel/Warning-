Foodborne Disease Outbreaks, 1998-2015 data from Kaggle


I used the “Foodborne Disease Outbreaks, 1998–2015” dataset from the CDC (available on Kaggle) as the basis for my final Python project to practice data analysis and draw meaningful insights. 
My analysis included:

Trend Analysis of Illnesses over Time
  Plotted total outbreak illnesses per year
  Computed year-to-year percent change to understand growth or decline in cases

Pathogen Frequency & Emergence Forecasting
  Tabulated incidence by pathogen (which ones appeared most often)
  Modeled a simple projection of new pathogen emergence, based on historical unique pathogen count trends

Geographic Insights by State
  Mapped outbreak frequency by U.S. state
  Identified “hotspot” states with significantly high counts (e.g., Florida)

Visualizations & Interpretation
  Line charts, bar plots, geographic maps
  Interpreted results in terms of public health implications, such as resource allocation and preventive strategies
